**IMMEDIATE STARTUP (5 minutes):**
```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd /d/workspace/java-techie-kotlin/ms-kotlin-backend

# 2. Set Go PATH (if needed)
export PATH=$PATH:"/c/Program Files/Go/bin"

# 3. Build ultra-fast monitor
go build -o monitor.exe monitor.go

# 4. Test the revolution!
./monitor.exe  # Should show 300ms refresh rate
```

**VALIDATION TASKS:**
1. **⚡ Performance Benchmark** (2 minutes)
   - [ ] Run old bash monitor: `./monitor.sh` (expect 9s delays)
