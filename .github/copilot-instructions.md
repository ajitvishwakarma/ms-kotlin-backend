# Copilot Instructions for Kotlin-Java Microservice Project

## Project Purpose
This project is a **Kotlin-based microservice for interview preparation** and to help Java developers transition to Kotlin. The primary goal is to **quickly revise Kotlin concepts, microservices patterns, and real-world coding scenarios** for job interviews.

## üéØ **FOCUS AREAS (Interview Priorities)**
1. **Kotlin Language Features**: Data classes, null safety, coroutines, extension functions
2. **Microservices Patterns**: Service discovery, configuration management, messaging
3. **Spring Boot + Kotlin**: Integration, best practices, common interview questions
4. **Real-world Scenarios**: Database integration, REST APIs, error handling

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **EFFICIENCY RULES**
- **Keep it simple**: Don't over-engineer solutions
- **Speed over perfection**: Focus on learning and quick iteration
- **Interview-relevant only**: Skip complex infrastructure unless directly needed
- **Time-conscious**: User has limited time for interview prep
- **Use parallelism**: Execute independent tasks in parallel to save time and resources
- **Batch operations**: Group related file operations and commands for efficiency
- **ALWAYS ASK BEFORE IMPLEMENTING**: When multiple solutions exist, present options and wait for user choice - NEVER implement without confirmation

## Microservice Overview

**Organized Structure:**
- **Root Level Scripts**: Main workflow scripts (`start-infra.sh`, `start-dev.sh`, `monitor.sh`, `status-check.sh`)
- **script-utils/**: Build optimization utilities only
- **infrastructure/**: All infrastructure components with co-located init scripts
  - **databases/**: MongoDB + MySQL with init scripts in same folder
  - **vault/**: Secrets management with JSON configs in `secrets/` subfolder
  - **kafka/**: Messaging + UI components
- **core-services/**: Configuration and Discovery servers
- **business-services/**: Product and Order services (main focus for learning)

**Architecture:**
- **Infrastructure**: Automated startup with `./start-infra.sh`, co-located init scripts
- **Core Services**: Spring Cloud Config + Eureka Discovery
- **Business Services**: REST APIs with database integration (main interview focus)
- **Monitoring**: Real-time with `./monitor.sh`, quick check with `./status-check.sh`
- **Secrets**: Dynamic loading from JSON files in `infrastructure/vault/secrets/`

## Planned/Upcoming Features

The project will be extended with:

- **API Gateway**: Central entry point for all APIs, routing, authentication, and rate limiting.
- **Fallback/Circuit Breaker**: Resilience patterns (e.g., Hystrix, Resilience4j) for handling service failures gracefully.
- **Centralized Logging**: Aggregated logs for all services (e.g., ELK stack, Loki, etc.).
- **HashiCorp Vault Integration**: Secure secrets management for sensitive configuration.

When adding new features (API Gateway, fallback, logging, Vault, etc.), update this file and `KOTLIN-JAVA-INTERVIEW-NOTES.md` with:
- A brief description of the feature and its purpose.
- How it integrates with existing services.
- Any new patterns, libraries, or best practices introduced.
- Interview-focused notes and code samples comparing Kotlin and Java approaches.

## ‚ö° **PARALLELISM & EFFICIENCY GUIDELINES**

**ALWAYS optimize for speed and resource efficiency in all operations:**

### **Terminal Commands & File Operations**
- **Use command chaining**: `cmd1 && cmd2 && cmd3` for sequential dependencies
- **Parallel execution**: Use `&` for independent background tasks when safe
- **Batch file operations**: Group related `mv`, `cp`, `rm` commands with `&&`
- **Example**: `mv file1.sh . && mv file2.sh . && echo "Files moved"` instead of separate commands

### **Docker & Infrastructure**
- **Parallel service checks**: Check multiple containers simultaneously
- **Efficient volume mounts**: Update multiple compose files in batch
- **Resource optimization**: Use shared volumes and networks when possible

### **Documentation Updates**
- **Batch README updates**: Plan all documentation changes before execution
- **Parallel file reads**: Read multiple files when analyzing structure
- **Efficient search**: Use `grep_search` with regex alternation instead of multiple searches

### **Code Analysis & Updates**
- **Multi-file analysis**: Read related files in parallel when possible
- **Batch replacements**: Group related string replacements
- **Semantic search optimization**: Use broader queries to reduce tool calls

### **Project Organization**
- **Bulk moves**: Move multiple related files in single commands
- **Path updates**: Update all references to moved files in one pass
- **Directory cleanup**: Remove empty directories after bulk moves

### **Git Operations**
- **Logical grouping**: Commit related changes together
- **Parallel branch operations**: Handle multiple aspects simultaneously
- **Efficient status checks**: Batch git status and diff operations

**CRITICAL RULE**: Before any multi-step operation, plan for maximum parallelism and minimal tool calls.

## Development & Testing Workflow

**EFFICIENCY FIRST - Interview Prep Focus:**
1. **Quick Start**: `./start-infra.sh` + `./start-dev.sh` OR IntelliJ direct run
2. **Focus on Business Services**: `business-services/` folder - this is where you'll spend most time
3. **Test & Learn**: Use the running services to practice Kotlin coding patterns
4. **Monitor & Debug**: Use `./monitor.sh` for continuous health monitoring

**Typical Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Start infrastructure
./start-infra.sh

# 2. Start monitoring in background (optional)
./monitor.sh &

# 3. Start development services
./start-dev.sh

# 4. Develop with real-time health visibility
```

**Infrastructure Management:**
- Infrastructure is automated - don't spend time on DevOps unless needed
- Use `./start-infra.sh` for infrastructure, `./start-dev.sh` for services
- Focus your time on Kotlin language features and business logic
- **Monitoring**: Use `./monitor.sh` for real-time health checks, `./status-check.sh` for quick status

**Code Changes Priority:**
1. **Business Services**: product-service, order-service (main learning focus)
2. **Kotlin Features**: Data classes, coroutines, extension functions
3. **Spring Boot Patterns**: Controllers, services, repositories
4. **Interview Scenarios**: REST APIs, database operations, error handling

**DON'T OVERCOMPLICATE:**
- Infrastructure is ready - focus on business logic
- Skip complex DevOps unless directly asked
- Prioritize Kotlin learning over infrastructure tweaks
- **Use efficiency patterns**: Always batch operations and use parallelism when possible

**INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL:**
- **ALWAYS use predefined scripts**: `./start-infra.sh`, `./stop-infra.sh`, `./start-dev.sh`, `./stop-dev.sh`, `./monitor.sh`, `./status-check.sh`
- **NO manual Docker commands**: Use the provided scripts unless explicitly asked to do manual operations
- **Infrastructure is automated**: Scripts handle container orchestration, networking, secrets loading
- **Focus on business services**: Spend time on `business-services/` folder, not infrastructure tweaks

**DECISION MAKING PROTOCOL:**
- **Present Options First**: When multiple solutions exist, explain each option with pros/cons
- **Wait for User Choice**: NEVER implement multiple approaches without explicit user selection
- **Confirm Before Action**: Always ask "Which option would you prefer?" or "Should I proceed with this approach?"
- **Respect User Time**: Present concise options but let user decide the direction

## Git Commit Best Practices

**Logical Grouping:**
- Always group related changes into separate commits by their purpose
- Never combine unrelated changes (e.g., feature + documentation + fixes) into one commit
- Create focused, atomic commits that can be reviewed and reverted independently

**When Asked for Git Messages:**
- Suggest which files to group together and their respective commit messages
- Provide clear, descriptive commit messages following conventional commit format
- Group by: features, fixes, documentation, dependencies, configuration, etc.

**When Asked to Commit:**
- Automatically group and commit changes logically without asking
- Use meaningful commit messages with proper prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, etc.
- Include detailed descriptions for complex changes
- Reference related issues or architectural decisions when relevant

**Commit Message Format:**
```
<type>: <subject>

<optional body with detailed explanation>
- Bullet points for multiple changes
- Technical details and reasoning
- Impact on other components
```

**Common Groupings:**
1. **Dependencies**: `build.gradle`, `pom.xml` changes
2. **Configuration**: Properties files, config changes
3. **Features**: New functionality implementation
4. **Fixes**: Bug fixes and error corrections
5. **Documentation**: README, troubleshooting, interview notes
6. **Refactoring**: Code improvements without behavior changes

## Documentation & Contribution Guidance

**Project Knowledge & Setup:**
- Update `README.md` with all project-specific knowledge, architecture, setup, and service integration details. This file is the single source of truth for understanding the project structure and service interactions.

**Troubleshooting:**
- Document all issues and their solutions in `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`. For each issue, include the error message, root cause, and the fix. This helps future contributors quickly resolve common issues.

**Script Organization:**
- Main workflow scripts remain at root level: `start-infra.sh`, `start-dev.sh`, `monitor.sh`, `status-check.sh`
- Utility scripts for optimization in `script-utils/`: `optimize-builds.sh`, `optimize-docker-builds.sh`
- Infrastructure components have co-located init scripts for efficiency

**Kotlin/Java Q&A and Interview Notes:**
- All Kotlin/Java interview Q&A, explanations, and comparisons must be added to `docs/guides/KOTLIN-JAVA-INTERVIEW-NOTES.md`.
- When a new Kotlin/Java topic is discussed, update this file with concise, interview-focused notes and code samples.
- Use side-by-side comparisons (tables or code blocks) to highlight differences between Kotlin and Java, as seen in the current notes.
- Whenever you have any doubts or questions related to Kotlin (language features, patterns, best practices, etc.), research and update `KOTLIN-JAVA-INTERVIEW-NOTES.md` with your findings, explanations, and code samples. This will help grow the knowledge base for all contributors.

## Code Patterns & Conventions

- Use Kotlin idioms (data classes, null safety, extension functions, coroutines) and explain them with Java analogies where possible.
- For every Kotlin feature or pattern, provide a Java equivalent or note if there is none.
- Avoid using Lombok in Kotlin code; document why in the notes if asked.
- Build: Use Gradle wrapper scripts (`./gradlew build` or `gradlew.bat build`).
- Tests: Place tests under `src/test/kotlin/` and run with Gradle.
- Main code is under `src/main/kotlin/`.
- Keep explanations concise and interview-oriented.
- Use markdown tables for feature comparisons.
- Reference key files and directories in explanations (e.g., `Product.kt` for data class examples).
- When refactoring or enriching the notes, always preserve existing valuable content.

**Examples:**
- When documenting a Kotlin data class, show the Java POJO and Lombok equivalent.
- For null safety, show how Kotlin's nullable types compare to Java's approach.

## Motivation

The project is meant to help a Java developer quickly revise Kotlin, understand differences, and prepare for interviews with practical, side-by-side examples. **Efficiency and time optimization are key priorities** - use parallelism, batch operations, and co-located resources to minimize setup time and maximize learning focus.
